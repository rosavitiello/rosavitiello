Hello! I am a first-year PhD student at the [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) in the [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), advised by Prof. [Carolyn Rosé](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cprose/) and Prof. [Yonatan Bisk](https://yonatanbisk.com/). Previously, I finished my masters at CMU LTI where I was also advised by Prof. Rosé.

I am passionate about how technology may afford more accessible and readily available learning experiences. My research primarily focuses on educational technology and collaboration. In particular, I am broadly interested in designing user-centered technology to deepen complementary human-ai collaboration and learning.
