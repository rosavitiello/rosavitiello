🐕, 📚, 👾, 📺/🎥, 🎶, 🍜: Outside of work, I spend most of my time entertaining my energetic Australian Shepherd, Pablo (namesake from Picasso or, if preferred, Pablo Sanchez from Backyard Baseball). Like many, I also enjoy reading, video gaming, (obsessively re)watching movies/tv shows, music, and eating. As of writing, currently postulating over:
- 📚: babel by R.F. Kuang
- 👾: stardew valley
- 📺/🎥: abbot elementary
- 🎶 : JENNIE
- 🍜: [food in pgh](https://peaceful-fiber-aa6.notion.site/food-in-pgh-1e69ad7b97fb4abd83594ca972b66790?pvs=4)

🥏: I am also a competitive [ultimate frisbee player](../assets/img/personal/frisbee.jpg) on the national- and worlds-level. I currently play on the nationally ranked [Pittsburgh Parcha](https://www.instagram.com/pghparcha/) (portmanteau for [parking chair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parking_chair)) women's club team 🪑. I also coach the CMU Money Mellons women's college team 💰🍉. If you're ever wondering why I am in [insert random US state] over a weekend, it's probably for frisbee.
